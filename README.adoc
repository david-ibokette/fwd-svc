== Configuring the Interpreter via IntelliJ Idea

Add the Python plugin

From Youtrack:

[quote, some helpful commenter]
In 2019.3.5 I found it under Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Console | Python Console and picked my Anaconda Python as the specified interpreter but the "No Python interpreter configured for the module" warning message did not go away. I had to go to Project Structure | Modules, find the module with my python code, click on dependencies and select the Anaconda Python. I then had to restart IntelliJ.
